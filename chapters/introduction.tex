In a recent survey titled `Ubiquity of large graphs'\cite{sahu2017ubiquity}, the
authors noted that the size of graphs being used in both academia and industry
is increasing. Although this survey found that it was common for graphs to have
tens of billions of edges, it also found that scalability was the primary
concern of all the participants surveyed\cite{sahu2017ubiquity}. In this thesis,
we evaluate one way to alleviate this concern of scalability by decoupling
storage of base graph from the evaluation of queries on the graph.
