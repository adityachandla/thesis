This thesis was completed as part of the Master of Computer Science
program at TU Eindhoven. This specific project was carried out within the
Databases group and under the guidance of Dr Nikolay Yakovets. First and
foremost, I would like to thank Nick for letting me decide the topic and
contents of this project. This gave me experience of how to go from a
vague idea to concrete research questions. Successfully navigating this process gave me
confidence in my ability to explore the research on a particular topic and
discover research gaps. Nick's guidance was also crucial in keeping the project
on course, preventing me from getting bogged down in trivialities. Furthermore, 
his insights often revealed interesting
questions that I had not originally planned to explore, but incorporating those
insights has enhanced the comprehensiveness of this work and, hopefully, the
reading experience. I would also like to thank my friends and colleagues who have
made my life outside academics more enjoyable. Finally, I would like to thank my
parents for enabling me to study at TU Eindhoven and for providing
constant support and encouragement throughout my degree.
